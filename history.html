            <h2>History & Origins</h2>

            <p>
                Nordic Minimalism emerged in the early 20th century within
                Scandinavian countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and
                Finland. Designers responded to industrial change by emphasizing
                objects and spaces that were practical, honest, and comfortable
                to use.
            </p>

            <p>
                Their work relied on natural materials, soft light, and simple
                forms. As the style spread into global architecture and digital
                products, the core idea remained: reduce visual noise so that
                people can focus on what matters.
